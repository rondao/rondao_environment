# Rond√£o Linux Environment

Run a single script to configure settings, install applications and prepare a consistent environment with my preferences.

```
$ ./rondao_env.sh
```

By default all apps listed are installed.
If you don't want all apps you can run in Interactive mode.
A checklist dialog will be presented to choose apps to install.

```
$ ./rondao_env.sh -i
```
